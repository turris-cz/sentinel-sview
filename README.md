# Sentinel:View

A component visualising data gathered by **Sentinel**.

## Python requirements

Python Package Index requirements (including the development ones) are stated in
`setup.py`

## Infrastructure requirements

- InfluxDB
- Redis server


## Development usage

- Establish python virtual environment (use
  [wrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) optionally)
  and install `sview` package. Consider using `-e` option: `pip install -e .`
- Create `.env` file with local environment variables (see `.env.example`)
- Set the configuration in `instance/local.cfg`. The default configuration
  can be found in `sview/default_settings.py`.
- Run the application using `flask run` (Use wsgi server for production!)
- Run some workers using `flask rq worker`. (Using only `rq worker` would lack
  any configuration and would end up working outside the application context).


## Data processing

To see up-to-date data, one should execute:

```
flask queue-queries
```

In application context (`dotenv` or `FLASK_APP=sview`).

On production, this should be run via cron.


Data about attackers, passwords and other details are queued on-demand, when a
user attempt to access them via web.
