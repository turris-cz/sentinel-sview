        <p>For the tables like <b>Password deltas</b> and <b>Port trends</b> comparing old and new results we start with
        data gathered on a topic for passed month and compare them with same samples in the month before. For other type
        of data, we run queries to find outmean or median for the month.</p>
        <p>We gather our data from internal and also public sources.</p>
