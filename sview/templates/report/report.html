  overall statistics due to their real-time nature.</p>

    <h3>How are the reports prepared</h2>
        <p>For the tables like <em>Password deltas</em> and <em>Port trends</em>, we are comparing
        data we gathered on the topic for the past month with the same samples from the month before. For other types
        of data, we run more complex queries over the raw anonymized data to find the relevant statistics for the month.</p>
